### STM32 Build IoT Application From Scratch With RYWB116 WiFi Module
In this tutorial I am sharing with you guys the IoT application I have build using STM32 with RYWB116 WiFi module in order to interact with an HTTP server implemented using Flask Web Framework. The server is deployed over a local network so all the connected smart devices can communicate with the server within the local network.

SQLalchemy is used for database management to store data received over HTTP POST from the server clients and send it over HTTP RESPONSE as a response for HTTP GET Jsonrequest. 

JSON is is used to come over the big HTML header and extract only the necessary data from the HTTP server. NX_JSON library is used by STM32 to parse JSON objects.
